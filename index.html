                <p>Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,

                    Studying at the undergraduate level will be a novel experience for students that just passed Senior High School level. It will be a milestone for those who seek knowledge, skill, and a determined path of their future career. Unpreparedness and uncertainty will be daunting for new students that have got used to learning in a more structured environment.                     
                    The curriculum reflects our effort to keep up teaching and learning material with the rapid technology growth, while maintaining pedagogy and instructional requirements to the highest quality. The curriculum development involves practitioners, educational experts, and graduates’ users from Industry and schools alike to obtain industry insight that is embedded into the curriculum.                    
                    We encourage students to actively participate in local, national, and international events to expose them to the social, academic, and research community in information technology that they will be joining soon after graduating from the reputable institution.                     
                    Established in 2012, the Informatics Education Department, Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Universitas Sebelas Maret remain in its infancy. However, the faculty achievement, network of expertise with users in Schools and Industry alike, encourage us to be more confident that success is a result of the effort of solid teamwork.                     
                    May Allah almighty bless us with guidance and perseverance to pursue our success.                    
                    Wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.</p>

                <h2>Ptik-UNS Profile</h2>
                <p>The Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta is an Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK) which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.
                    The Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK) study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK) department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK 
                    is a study program that will produce graduates who are prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as Building Engineering Education, and Mechanical Engineering Education. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct resource sharing with the mathematics study program.</p>

                    <p>Under the auspices of the PTK department, the PTIK study program will focus on study materials in the field of vocational education in the field of information technology and computers. Departing from the focus of study materials in the field of vocational education in the field of information technology and computers, the PTIK study program curriculum is prepared on the basis of vocational education science and information technology and computer science. Educational Science Foundations (vocational education) are provided through educational subjects such as Education Fundamentals, Learning Technology, Educational Professions, Inclusive Education, Guidance and Counseling, and Student Development. This education field is given in all study programs at FKIP UNS as a group of Basic Educational Subjects (MKDK). In addition to courses included in the MKDK group, courses that support the professional duties of an educator are also given, such as Educational Evaluation, Learning Planning, and Teaching and Learning Strategies. Meanwhile, for the development of competence in the field of education, students are also provided with research subjects in the field of education, micro teaching and teaching practice (PPL). The curriculum in the education sector is also adapted to the existence of the PTIK study program under the CAR program which focuses on the field of vocational education (vocational education).

                        The courses that distinguish the PTIK study program from other study programs at FKIP UNS are in supporting professional competence courses that focus on the field of information technology and computer science. The group of courses that support professional competence include algorithms 
                        and programming, discrete mathematics, databases, operating systems, computer networks, computer architecture, computational theory, software engineering, web design and programming, and intelligent systems.</p>
